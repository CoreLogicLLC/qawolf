To run your tests against your local server, open the `./.github/workflows/qawolf.yml` file.

You'll notice a commented out step of the workflow called `Start local server`:

```yaml
# - name: Start local server
#   run: npm run start & npx wait-on http://localhost:3000
```

Comment in this code, and edit it as you like. The example first runs the script `npm run start`, and then waits for the URL `localhost:3000` to be available:

```yaml
- name: Start local server
  run: npm run start & npx wait-on http://localhost:3000
```

You may want to replace `npm run start` with a different command, or `localhost:3000` with a different URL.

See [GitHub Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun) to learn more about running commands.
