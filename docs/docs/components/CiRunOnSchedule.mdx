To configure when your tests run, open the `./.github/workflows/qawolf.yml` file.

Near the top of the file, you'll see some commented out code to run your tests on a schedule:

```yaml
name: qawolf
on:
  push:
    # test every branch
    # edit below if you only want certain branches tested
    branches: "*"
  # schedule:
  #   # test on schedule using cron syntax
  #   - cron: "0 * * * *" # every hour
# ...
```

Comment in this code to run your tests on a schedule. How often your tests run is specified using [cron syntax](https://crontab.guru/). By default, your tests will run every hour on the hour:

```yaml
name: qawolf
on:
  push:
    # test every branch
    # edit below if you only want certain branches tested
    branches: "*"
  schedule:
    # test on schedule using cron syntax
    - cron: "0 * * * *" # every hour
# ...
```

You can change the value passed to the `cron` key to run your tests on a different schedule:

```yaml
name: qawolf
on:
  push:
    # test every branch
    # edit below if you only want certain branches tested
    branches: "*"
  schedule:
    # test on schedule using cron syntax
    - cron: "0 0 * * *" # every day at midnight
# ...
```

If you do not want your tests to run when a commit is pushed, you can also remove or comment out the `push` code block:

```yaml
name: qawolf
on:
  schedule:
    # test on schedule using cron syntax
    - cron: "0 * * * *" # every hour
# ...
```
